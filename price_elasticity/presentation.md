    style A fill:#e3f2fd
    style G fill:#fff3e0
    style I fill:#e8f5e8
```

### Statistical Models Implemented

#### 1. Linear Demand Model
```
Quantity = α + β₁(Price_Own) + β₂(Price_Comp_A) + β₃(Price_Comp_B) + β₄(Seasonality) + β₅(Promotion) + ε
```

**Key Features:**
- Own-price elasticity at mean values
- Cross-price elasticity with competitors
- Seasonal adjustment factors
- Promotional impact quantification

#### 2. Log-Linear Elasticity Model
```
log(Quantity) = α + β₁log(Price_Own) + β₂log(Price_Comp_A) + β₃log(Price_Comp_B) + β₄(Seasonality) + β₅(Promotion) + ε
```

**Advantages:**
- Constant elasticity interpretation
- Direct coefficient = elasticity
- Better fit for non-linear relationships
- Multiplicative seasonal effects

#### 3. Model Selection Criteria

| Model Type | Premium R² | Mid-Tier R² | Value R² | Recommended |
|------------|------------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| Linear | 0.82 | 0.78 | 0.85 | Baseline |
| Log-Linear | **0.87** | **0.83** | **0.91** | ✅ **Preferred** |
| Time Series | 0.84 | 0.81 | 0.88 | Alternative |
